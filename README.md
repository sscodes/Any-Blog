# Any-Blog
This is a general purpose website template, made of only HTML &amp; CSS.

UPDATE: Original color's changed, It fixed to fit on laptops for the moment and right sidebar was fixed too when resizing the page with CSS to avoid sidebar overlaps with the content of the page.

On a future I will implement a Administration Page in PHP
